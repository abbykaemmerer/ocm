    Outdoor construction design fortifies the functionality of the garden, pulling the user out as a participant rather than an observer.  It allows the space to become a work of art.  Outdoor rooms are created by intermingling and manipulating floors, ceilings, walls and doors.  Different material is chosen and integrated to bring about contrasting garden experiences.  Our designers will work with you from the initial design to the completion of the project.
