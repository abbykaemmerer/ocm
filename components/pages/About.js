  <p class="aboutpara">
  I currently work as a developer in an Agile environment for a IT consulting firm where we work mostly with AngularJS, Java, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BitBucket, Jenkins, ALM, and Swagger. After graduating from the University of Missouri, I decided to continue my education by enrolling in a Front-End Development bootcamp. We learned JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, version control, GitHub, Netlify, and Trello. From my education and professional experience, I have learned how to optimize my time while working with many different teams and people. My experiences have taught me to be persistent, curious and efficient while also maintaining my creativity and passion for web development.
